- I didn't use an individual css file for `LightContainerClass`

- I imported the data into Two different Components when both use the same unchanged data
  <br>
  `LightContainerFunctional.jsx`
  `LightContainerClass.jsx`

  ***

1. Is it bad practice to link a component's css file to multiple components?

2. In this case would it have been better to import the data into `App.jsx` and pass it as props to both Components?
